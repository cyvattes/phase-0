What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
  - This challenge made my brain hurt, and made me feel incrediply clever when I got it working. The hardest part of this challenge was figuring out how to iterate over the parts of a multidimensional array.
Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
  - I feel like I'm getting better at breaking my coding down into smaller parts. However, I had to go back to pseudocoding after I got half-finished with my code, as I ran into problems that I hadn't thought of before.
Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
  - I feel like I came up with a good and efficient solution to solving this problem. I feel that maybe learning about different methods might have helped, but that's speculating about things I don't know yet.
What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
  - I decided to go with a multidimentional array (2 dimensions), which allowed me to break each accountability group into an array of 5 students, each array held within a master array. I felt (and still feel) that this is the best way to arrange the names into groups.
What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
  - While I didn't learn any new methods for this project, it was my first time using the Array.new class to make a new array. I did this to make an array within an array, while using variables to set their length. Refactoring helped make the code much neater at the end, but I did a lot of this as I went because it ended up meaning a lot less typing when I was determining how big each array should be.
