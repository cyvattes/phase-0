## 1.1 Think About Time
  In section 1.1 I read about the posted time management techniques,
  but took more interest in the Fogg Technique, and the ways in which
  we can create and enforce habits. I dug a little deeper on these topics,
  as well as different versions of timeboxing (pomodoro method, etc.).
  Timeboxing is a method for setting hard time limits for sessions of work,
  typically followed by a short break period. I think timeboxing is an
  effective way to keep productivity high without burnout in Phase 0,
  where we are left to our own devices for productivity.

  Currently I manage my time with blocked off sessions in my calendar/planner,
  similar to the way timeblocks are used, but without the strict periods.
  This has worked decently well in the past, but has sometimes led to burnout,
  as my planner usually calls for sitting down for “work” for x number
  of hours, and I feel that employing better use of timeblocks will help
  alleviate this problem. I will be implementing timeblocks
  (testing the pomodoro method to start), and will work on enforcing
  the habits I have and creating new ones using Fogg’s method.
  My time management plan for phase 0 is to modify my current techniques
  to incorporate the more tried-and-true methods of pomodoro and Fogg to
  ensure that work is done consistently and without burnout
  or need for motivating speeches.

## 1.2 The Command Line
  1: A shell is a program used by the operating system to receive and interpret
    commands and to output data, with bash being a shell used by Unix.
	2: As I have used different Linux distributions for years, and have a solid
	  experience with using terminal commands, the most challenging thing for me
	  was to relearn commands used in Windows (which I am currently running).
	  I completed the training section using PowerShell, but am now quite
	  comfortable being back in Cloud9 running Unix commands.
	3: I was able to use all commands successfully.
	4: I think the most important commands to know are “pwd”, “ls”, and “cd”.
	  After all, knowing where you are and how to move around is a
	  pretty solid foundation.
	
	pwd: “Print Working Directory” - shows your location directory
	ls: “List” - shows all directories and files in your current location
	mv: “Move” - moves a file to another directory
	cd: “Change Directory” - changes your current location directory
	“../”: moves you up one directory, and can be stringed together
	  (“/” for each itteration)
	touch: creates a new empty file
	mkdir: “Make Directory” - creates a new empty directory
	less: displays a file, one page at a time, which can be tabbed through
	rmdir: “Remove Directory” - deletes a folder
	  (but not subdirectories unless -r is used)
	rm: “Remove” - deletes a file (also deletes directories in windows)
	help: displays information on how to use a command


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning
  *Instructions* Getting repositories set up with GitHub is surprisingly easy.
  
  To create a new repo, simply click the green “+ New Repository” button from
  your home screen in GitHub. From there, you will be allowed to name the repo,
  and decide whether it should be public or private. 
  
  To fork a repo, go to the repo on GitHub and click the fork button.
  This will create a version of the repo that you can work on without
  affecting the original.
  
  To clone a repo, copy the URL from the GitHub page
  (this will be in a box labeled HTTPS at the top of the page),
  navigate to the your git working directory in the terminal, and enter
  “git clone [url goes here]”
	
	The hardest part of getting set up with git and GitHub was getting
	out of my own way. I was worried that I would do something wrong,
	but it turned out to be much simpler than I’d expected.
	I am still a little uneasy with using git from the command line,
	but I’m sure that will fade as I become more familiar with using
	the command line. In the process of getting set up, I learned a lot
	about git, what it does, and how to use it. I have heard of git many
	times before, but had never experienced using it.
