What does puts do?
  - puts prints the output to the screen and adds a new line below it. It doesn't return a value.
What is an integer? What is a float?
  - An integer is a terminating number (positive or negative) with no decimal point. A float is a number with (floating) decimal points.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  - Float division is the same kind of division (with decimal points) that we all learned as kids, whereas integer division will truncate the answer, dropping any decimal off the end and giving you an answer that is rounded down. For example, 9.0/2.0 = 4.5, but 9/2 = 4 (float, then integer).

```ruby
puts 365 * 24
puts 365 * 10 *24 * 60
```
