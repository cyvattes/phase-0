- What is a wireframe?
    A wireframe is a quick black and white sketch of a webpage which shows a simple outline for its layout.  
- What are the benefits of wireframing?
    Wireframes allow the designer, developer, and/or client to look over the layout for a site before coding begins, allowing them to make changes quickly and easily.
- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
    Wireframing the site forced me to think a lot more about the layout that I otherwise would have until too late. I thought it was enjoyable, but somewhat outside my comfort zone.
- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
    My index page came together pretty quickly, but I toyed around and revised my blog-index wireframe several times.
- What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
    As I started the challenge using balsamiq's web app, I had issues downloading/exporting to an image rather than a .bmml file. I had to search through their forums for an explanation, and ended up having to download and use their desktop program instead.
- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
    I enjoyed being able to visualize the site and move things around freely, but found it difficult and tedious finding a middleground between visual style and usability for the blog index (something that would work with our limited knowledge of html and eventually css).
