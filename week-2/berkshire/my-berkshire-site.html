    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
        It was interesting seeing how things work after they're typed out, and trying to solve the issues as they came up. I learned a lot about semantics.
        
    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
        The suggestion in the intro to html video to use HTML5 Doctor was brilliant. It helped immensely when trying to find the proper verbiage for tags.
        
    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
        I took the training videos to heart and was very careful not to start adding formatting to the page.
        
    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
        The good is that HTML seems very simple and straight-forward. The bad is that it seems easy to fall into bad habits of formatting, and the need for outside formatting like CSS seems like a pain.
        
    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
        So far I haven't had any issues with remembering the tags, but I think I will have to use flash cards to remember the proper format for links and images.
