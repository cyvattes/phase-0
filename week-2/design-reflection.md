1: What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  The 6 phases of web design are:
    1 - Gather Information (find out purpose and needs of site)
    2 - Planning (create written plan of needed features)
    3 - Design (build a specific design/layout for the site)
    4 - Development (create the site)
    5 - Testing/Delivery (ensure the site works and deliver to the client)
    6 - Maintenance (ensure ongoing functionality of the site)
2: What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  The site's primary goal will be to showcase my experience, talents, and skills. It will feature content such as contact info, previous projects, links to social media, and my blog.
3: What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  It will function as a living cv for employers, clients, and coworkers to view information about me. If a potential employer wants information regarding my skills, they will be able to find detailed information and examples of past projects on the site.
4: What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  Contact information and portfolio will be readily available, and should be easy to find and navigate to.
5: What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  It is important that design focus on how accessible and well received the site is for end users. User experience (UX) is an important component of this, and focuses on how users react to the site emotionally.
6: What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
  UX focuses on delivering a positive user experience and making important functions easily accessible and understood (for instance, checking out in an online marketplace should be simple and inviting). Even small changes to the user experience can site traffic or conversion.
7: Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  This challenge was relatively straight-forward, and I didn't find any parts of it particularly tedious.
