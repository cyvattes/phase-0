    <!--
    What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
      - Ensure that the stylesheet is linked via relative path so that it can be found regardless of which machine is running the html.
    What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
      - We made good use of float and text-align to position text. We tried using percent spacing to position the table elements, but were having issues making it work, so we ended up using "px" instead.
    What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
      - We used font-size, color, background-color, text-align, block (for page-breaks), margin/padding, borders, width, and float.
    Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
      - We used classes to format our unordered list into a table, and IDs for the unique footer sections of the page. You would want to use classes whenever you would be using an element more than once.
    When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
      - While the source code from the original site functioned, it looked messy and hard to read. Best practices would include linking to external css rather that prolific use of in-line css, so I feel that we had cleaner code overall.
